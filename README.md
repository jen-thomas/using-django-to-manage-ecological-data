# Using Django to manage ecological data

This repository contains a presentation about our experience of using Django to manage ecological survey data. It was initially created for the [SORTEE conference (2022)](https://www.sortee.org/upcoming/). 

## Summary of the presentation

Ecological data is often recorded and managed in spreadsheets. While this is very useful at the smaller scale, once we get to hundreds of records, it can become a bit unwieldy. On top of that, it is very easy to create "messy" data in spreadsheets, where there is little to prevent typos, copy and paste errors, incorrect data in the wrong place and so on. To solve this problem, we used Django to build a database structure and manage our data from ecological surveys. In this presentation, we describe the problem, how we used Django, the advantages and some considerations to take into account, and where to go next if you would like to give it a go.

## Example Django applications

Although in this presentation we describe our experience of using Django for managing ecological data, it can be (and is) used to manage any kind of data. This talk is based on the Django application which is used for managing [wildlife observations](https://github.com/jen-thomas/wildlife-observations). We have successfully used Django applications on a much larger scale to manage data during ship-based research expeditions, e.g. the [Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition](https://github.com/Swiss-Polar-Institute/science-cruise-data-management).

# Questions and to get in touch

We are very excited to use Django applications to help with data entry and managing data. In the realm of ecology (and in science in general, as far as we can tell), it is not very well-known, so we would be very happy to answer any questions. Feel free to get in touch with Carles ([carles@pina.cat](carles@pina.cat)) or Jen ([jen@falciot.net])(jen@falciot.net).
